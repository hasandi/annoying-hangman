# Annoying Hangman
This is a simple game of hangman, but annoying.

This was made for my assignment of Web Design & Programming subject in college. I'm using jQuery and simple HTML and CSS. You can click the keyboard on the screen instead to play, or use your keyboard instead. You can also play it on your smartphone, thanks to the CSS that makes the website responsive.
